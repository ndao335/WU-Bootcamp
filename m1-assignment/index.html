                <hr class="dashed">
                <p>In Greek mythology, Perseus (/ˈpɜːrsiəs, -sjuːs/; Greek: Περσεύς) is the legendary founder of 
                Mycenae and of the Perseid dynasty. He was, alongside Cadmus and Bellerophon, the greatest 
                Greek hero and slayer of monsters before the days of Heracles. He beheaded the Gorgon Medusa 
                for Polydectes and saved Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus. He was the son of Zeus and the 
                mortal Danaë, as well as the half-brother and great-grandfather of Heracles (as they were both 
                sired by Zeus).</p>

                <hr class="dashed">
                <p>Because of the obscurity of the name "Perseus" and the legendary character of its bearer, 
                most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus' native 
                city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it 
                descended into Greek from the Proto-Indo-European language. In that regard Robert Graves has 
                proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb πέρθειν 
                (pérthein, "to waste, ravage, sack, destroy") some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. 
                According to Carl Darling Buck (Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin), the suffix is 
                typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the aorist stem, pers-. Pers-eus 
                therefore is a "sacker of cities", that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the 
                first Mycenaean warrior.</p>
                <p>The further origin of perth- is more obscure. J. B. Hofmann lists the possible root
                , from which Latin ferio, "strike". This corresponds to Julius Pokorny’s, 
                "scrape, cut." Ordinarily descends to Greek . This difficulty can be overcome by 
                presuming a dissimilation in pérthein, which the Greeks would have preferred from 
                a putative phérthein. Graves carries the meaning still further, to the perse- in Persephone, 
                goddess of death. John Chadwick in the second edition of Documents in Mycenaean Greek speculates 
                about the Mycenaean goddess, attested on the PY Tn 316 tablet and 
                tentatively reconstructed as Preswa.</p>
                <p>A Greek folk etymology connected "Perseus" to the name of the Persian people, 
                whom they called the Pérsai (from Old Persian Pārsa "Persia, a Persian"). The 
                native name of this people, however, has always in Persian. Herodotus 
                recounts this story, devising a foreign son, Perses, from whom the Persians took the 
                name. Apparently also the Persians knew the story, as Xerxes tried to use it to bribe 
                the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.</p>

                <h3>Origin at Argos</h3>

                <p>
                    Perseus was the son of Zeus and Danaë, the daughter of Acrisius, King of Argos. 
                    Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consulted the oracle at Delphi, 
                    who warned him that he would one day be killed by his daughter's son. In order to keep Danaë 
                    childless, Acrisius imprisoned her in a bronze chamber, open to the sky, in the courtyard of 
                    his palace: This mytheme is also connected to Ares, Oenopion, Eurystheus, and others. 
                    Zeus came to her in the form of a shower of gold, and fathered her son Perseus. Soon after, 
                    their child was born; Perseus—"Perseus Eurymedon, for his mother gave him this name as well" 
                    (Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica IV).</p>

                    <p>Fearful for his future, but unwilling to provoke the wrath of the gods by killing the offspring 
                    of Zeus and his daughter, Acrisius cast the two into the sea in a wooden chest. Danaë's 
                    fearful prayer, made while afloat in the darkness, has been expressed by the poet Simonides of Ceos. 
                    Mother and child washed ashore on the island of Seriphos, where they were taken in by the fisherman 
                    Dictys ("fishing net"), who raised the boy to manhood. The brother of Dictys was Polydectes 
                    ("he who receives/welcomes many"), the king of the island.</p>
                
                
                <h3>Overcoming the Gorgon</h3>
                <p>When Perseus was grown, Polydectes came to fall in love with the beautiful Danaë. 
                    Perseus believed Polydectes was less than honourable, and protected his mother from him; 
                    then Polydectes plotted to send Perseus away in disgrace. He held a large banquet where 
                    each guest was expected to bring a gift. Polydectes requested that the guests bring 
                    horses, under the pretense that he was collecting contributions for the hand of Hippodamia, 
                    daughter of Oinomaos. Perseus had no horse to give, so he asked Polydectes to name the gift; 
                    he would not refuse it. Polydectes held Perseus to his rash promise and demanded the head of 
                    the only mortal Gorgon, Medusa, whose gaze turned people to stone. Ovid's account of Medusa's 
                    mortality tells that she had once been a woman, vain of her beautiful hair. Poseidon, 
                    the god of the seas, had sex with her inside a temple dedicated to Athena, and as punishment 
                    for the desecration of her temple, Athena had changed Medusa's hair into hideous snakes "that 
                    she may alarm her surprised foes with terror".</p>

                    Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: Perses, Alcaeus, Heleus, Mestor, Sthenelus, Electryon, 
                    and Cynurus, and two daughters, Gorgophone and Autochthe. Perses was left in Aethiopia and 
                    was believed to have been an ancestor of the Persians. The other descendants ruled Mycenae 
                    from Electryon to Eurystheus, after whom Atreus got the kingdom. However, the Perseids included 
                    the great hero, Heracles, stepson of Amphitryon, son of Alcaeus. The Heraclides, or descendants 
                    of Heracles, successfully contested the rule of the Atreids.</p>
                <p>
                    A statement by the Athenian orator, Isocrates[27] helps to date Perseus approximately. 
                    He said that Heracles was four generations later than Perseus, which corresponds to the 
                    legendary succession: Perseus, Electryon, Alcmena, and Heracles, who was a contemporary of 
                    Eurystheus. Atreus was one generation later, a total of five generations.</p>
